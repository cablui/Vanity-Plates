CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python is a Harvard course that introduces programming concepts through Python, with hands-on projects to build real-world skills.

This is a C# console application based on the "Vanity Plates" exercise from Harvard’s CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python.
In this version, I reimplemented the original Python logic using C#, applying the same validation rules for custom license plates.

The program ensures that:
1. Plates start with at least two letters;
2. They contain between 2 and 6 alphanumeric characters;
3. Numbers, if present, must appear only at the end — and not start with zero;
4. No spaces, punctuation, or special characters are allowed.
